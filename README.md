# Predictive Model for Lifestyle and Diabetes Association

This project investigates how lifestyle and demographic factors influence diabetes risk. Using machine learning, we preprocess a health dataset and build predictive models to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic.

- [`Model_Fitting_dm_project.ipynb`](https://github.com/GayatriKshirsagar/PredictiveModelForLifestyleDiabetesAssociation/blob/main/DM_Final_Project/Model_Fitting_dm_project.ipynb): Model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

## üîç Objective

To build accurate and interpretable models that can predict diabetes based on lifestyle patterns using various machine learning algorithms.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Involved

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and scaled numerical data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualized class distributions and feature relationships.
- **Modeling**: Trained multiple models including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine
- **Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC-AUC

## ‚úÖ Outcome

The Random Forest model outperformed others in terms of accuracy and recall, making it the most reliable predictor in this context. Feature importance plots helped identify key contributors like BMI, physical activity, and dietary habits.
